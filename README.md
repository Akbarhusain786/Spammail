Description:-  I developed a Spam Detection System using machine learning to classify emails as spam or ham. The system processes email text with a CountVectorizer and trains a Naive Bayes classifier on labeled data to predict spam. Integrated with a Flask-based web app, it provides a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions. This project showcases the application of text classification and machine learning pipelines for solving real-world problems, with potential for scalability and enhancement using larger datasets and advanced models.
